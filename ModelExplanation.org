Column-Store indices is the term Microsoft uses for data that is
stored in decomposed format, meaning that data is stored such that all
attributes of a column are co-located. Since this query only touches
few columns but many tuples/rows (both in the review as well as the
business tables), data access locality is improved
significantly. Specifically, only two of the nine columns in review
and three of the twelve columns in business need to be read which
leads to significantly fewer page faults (i.e., better I/O
behaviour).

Bonus points: In addition to accessing fewer columns, SQL server
compresses data that is stored in decomposed form. This further
reduces the number of data access page faults.

Another bonus point: Since fewer columns are read, intermediate data
structures like the hash-table for the join are more likely to stay
cache resident which speeds up the join.
